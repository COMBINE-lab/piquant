Overview
========

The *piquant* pipeline consists of three main stages:

#. Simulate RNA-seq reads under specified combinations of sequencing parameters.
#. Run a number of transcriptome quantification tools (or the same tool with different optional parameter choices) on each set of simulated reads to estimate isoform abundances.
#. Generate statistics and graphs to assess and compare the accuracy of each quantification tool.

All three stages of the pipeline can be run via different commands of the ``piquant`` script. They are described in more detail below.
