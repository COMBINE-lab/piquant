Installation
============

.. note:: These instructions are temporary until a package has been submitted to PyPI.

.. attention:: As *piquant* has a number of dependencies on other Python packages, it is strongly recommended to install in an isolated environment using the `virtualenv <http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ tool; the `virtualenvwrapper <http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`_ makes managing multiple virtual environments easier.

Create and work in a virtual environment for *piquant* using the ``virtualenvwrapper`` tool::

    mkproject piquant

Clone the *piquant* GitHub repository into this environment::

    git clone https://github.com/lweasel/piquant.git .

Install Python packages required by *piquant*::

    pip install -r requirements.txt
