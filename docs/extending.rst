Extending piquant
=================

*piquant* is designed to be extensible in three principal ways:

* :ref:`extending-adding-new-quantifiers`: Adding an additional quantification tool or pipeline whose comparative performance can then be assessed.
* :ref:`extending-adding-new-statistics`: Adding an additional statistic to be calculated for each quantification run.
* :ref:`extending-adding-new-classifiers`: Adding an additional classifier to split transcripts into discrete groups, so that the performance of quantification tools can be assessed across these sets of transcripts.
